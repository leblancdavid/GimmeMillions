  "Abstract": "Although it had seen many huge crowds over the years, for inaugurations, Fourth of July fireworks, protests and parades, never in memory had the Mall in the nation's capital drawn multitudes for New Year's. But on this mild winter night with a lovely sunset, hundreds of thousands of people here thronged to the Mall for a long-planned celebration on the last New Year's Eve of the 1900's.    ''It's a very friendly crowd,'' Sgt. Frank R. Onolfi of the United States Park Police said as afternoon turned to evening.  ",
