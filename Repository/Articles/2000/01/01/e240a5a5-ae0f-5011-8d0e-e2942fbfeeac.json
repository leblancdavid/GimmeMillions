  "LeadParagraph": "Italy's budget deficit declined by almost half this year as tax evaders were forced to pay up, the government said. The deficit dropped to 31.6 trillion lire ($16.4 billion) from 58.34 trillion lire in 1998, the Treasury announced. The decline was partly because of a December surplus of some 25 trillion lire. ''The result was better than expected, and Italians have good reason to be satisfied,'' Treasury Minister Giuliano Amato said.",
