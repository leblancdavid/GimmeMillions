  "Abstract": "Scientists at IBM's Almaden Research Center in California are pushing the frontiers of computation; Isaac Chuang, a physicist, is working on a quantum computer; a conventional computer stores and retrieves information represented as ones and zeros, while a quantum computer simultaneously computes upon a potentially vast number of pieces of information in the space of the same one or zero; photo (M)",

  "LeadParagraph": "ISAAC CHUANG has built a machine that may one day leave the world's fastest supercomputers behind, but just now the thing is busy helping its master perform a little magic. Mr. Chuang holds out a paper clip in his cupped hand, and the clip instantly suspends itself in thin air, trapped in a force field generated by the weird device five feet away -- a quantum computer.",
