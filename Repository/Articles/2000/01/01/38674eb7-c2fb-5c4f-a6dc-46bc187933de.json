  "Abstract": "The pastel sky over the Bay of Fundy darkened from peach glow to dim lavender. Taps sounded; the flag descended; and there came the soft thunder of a muffled stampede: hearty applause from more than 300 pairs of gloved and mittened hands.     That is how, at 3:57 p.m. today, this easternmost town in the continental United States bade farewell to the last day of the 1990's, with a bone-chilling ceremony at the candy-cane-striped lighthouse at West Quoddy Head, the easternmost point of this easternmost town. A children's chorus did its tentative best, politicians spoke, and everybody went home for hot chocolate.  ",
