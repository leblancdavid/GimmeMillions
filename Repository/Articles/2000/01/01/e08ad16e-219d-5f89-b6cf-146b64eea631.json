  "LeadParagraph": "The Indonesian government will have to recapitalize its own central bank after state auditors refused to give Bank Indonesia a clean bill of health, the Finance Minister, Bambang Sudibyo, said. Two new investigations into the bank were also announced, including one to be led by Indonesia's attorney general. An audit released to Parliament by the state audit agency indicated that the central bank had negative net worth, Mr. Sudibyo said. There has been widespread talk that state auditors took issue with 51 trillion rupiah ($7.1 billion) lent by Bank Indonesia to banks as emergency liquidity support.",
