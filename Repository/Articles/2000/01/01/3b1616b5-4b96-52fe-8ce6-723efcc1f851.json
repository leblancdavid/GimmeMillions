  "LeadParagraph": "EACH day, in the courtyard of the nation's most secure federal prison in Florence, Colo., a strange convocation takes place. Three men stand in isolated mesh cages and talk for an hour. One prosecutor has called it ''the oddest kaffeeklatsch in the history of Western civilization.'' Its members are Timothy J. McVeigh, who bombed the federal office building in Oklahoma City; Theodore J. Kaczynski, the Unabomer; and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing. And recently, a place was reserved for Luis Felipe, the leader of the violent Latin Kings gang in New York, who arranged three murders from his prison cell.",
