  "Abstract": "U S West Inc., the local telephone company merging with Qwest Communications International Inc., said yesterday that it had sold 65 percent of its stake in Global Crossing Ltd. to take advantage of a rise in Global Crossing's shares. U S West sold about 24 million shares, valued at $1.15 billion. It bought the shares in June before canceling a planned merger with Global Crossing, a two-year-old company that is building a worldwide phone and data network. Global Crossing stock has risen about 84 percent since October. Global Crossing and U S West agreed to merge in May, but the deal fell apart in July after Qwest made a bid for both U S West and the Frontier Corporation. U S West eventually agreed to Qwest's $45.2 billion bid.  ",
