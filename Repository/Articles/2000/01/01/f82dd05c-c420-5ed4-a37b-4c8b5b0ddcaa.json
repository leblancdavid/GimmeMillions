  "LeadParagraph": "Next summer will provide either the best of times for the Mets, or the worst. Manager Bobby Valentine has one year left on his contract, as does General Manager Steve Phillips, and the team has mortgaged much of its farm system in an attempt to win in 2000. Either the Mets will contend for a championship, or many of them will be looking for jobs.",
