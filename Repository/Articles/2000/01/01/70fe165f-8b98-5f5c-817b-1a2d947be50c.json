  "LeadParagraph": "Despite warnings that too many people are overeducated, new high school graduates and adults long out of school are expected to flock to college in ever-growing numbers in the years ahead, even as the notion of higher education expands and changes. There will always be a Harvard (and a Yale and a Princeton). But other traditional colleges are likely to be bypassed as students seek convenience and specially tailored services -- and colleges respond. The watchwords will be high technology and cost efficiency, and courses will be delivered in many ways. For better or worse, the future is full of niches to be filled. Here are some institutions that higher education experts expect to be on the cutting edge.",
