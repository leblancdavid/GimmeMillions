  "Abstract": "Saddling up all its horses, putting all its helicopters in the air and sending nearly all its officers out on the street in uniform, the New York Police Department yesterday mounted one of its largest security operations ever -- three years in the planning and costing $6 million -- and by early this morning it appeared to have paid off with a genial and almost uneventful New Year's Eve.    Some 8,000 police officers blanketed Times Square alone -- a force larger than that of most of the country's municipal police departments -- for the most famous and symbolic gathering. But the police also had to cover 328 other officially scheduled celebrations in all five boroughs, including a gathering of tens of thousands of people at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn.  ",
