  "Abstract": "''But where are the snows of yesteryear?'' the poet Francois Villon asked in the 15th century, not even halfway through the millennium we are making a fuss about leaving. Nothing new under the sun, though in his case it was not an early global-warming alert but a lament for departed loveliness. Nothing new there either.    Maybe the past is prologue, but here at the changing of the hundred- and thousand-year guard, prologue is chiefly the past. The flood of writing on the subject, including this additional teacupful, looks back more than forward. ''Millennium'' has a great gong sound, but is it the gong announcing the end of an era or summoning the one to come? The first is bronze, the second is tin.  ",
