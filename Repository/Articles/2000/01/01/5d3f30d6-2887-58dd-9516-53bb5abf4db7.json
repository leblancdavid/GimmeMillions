  "LeadParagraph": "The enormous growth and subsequent unionization of the auto industry created opportunities for millions of Americans to enter the middle class. Alfred Bardelli, whose family immigrated from Italy to a Pennsylvania coal town 10 months after his birth in 1909, began cutting glass for windows in 1928 at Ford Motor's Rouge complex in Dearborn, near Detroit. It was the world's largest factory then, with 103,000 workers. He joined the United Automobile Workers in 1937, a time of violent clashes between union organizers and company security personnel. He is the sole surviving member of the negotiating team that concluded the U.A.W.'s first contract with Ford in 1941.",
