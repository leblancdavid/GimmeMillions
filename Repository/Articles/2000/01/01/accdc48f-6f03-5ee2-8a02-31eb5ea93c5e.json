  "LeadParagraph": "Lily Yen, born to a merchant family in Shanghai, was one of very few women in China able to attend a university in the early part of the 20th century. She volunteered to teach schoolgirls in a poor, inland rural province. War and recurrent political campaigns intruded, and Mrs. Yen's family was divided when half her relatives moved to Taiwan in 1949.
