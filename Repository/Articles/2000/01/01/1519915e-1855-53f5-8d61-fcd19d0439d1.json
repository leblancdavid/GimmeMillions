  "Abstract": "The last day of the 1900's arrived like any other at the foot of International Bridge No. 1: old women and cowboys, teenagers and tourists, all of them and thousands of others crossed back and forth from Mexico as if the notion of two countries were mostly an inconvenience not of their making.    ''It's like it was one city,'' said Terry Medinilla, a salesman at El Porvenir, a clothing store that depends on customers walking across the bridge from Mexico. ''We can't be without them, and they can't be without us.''  ",
