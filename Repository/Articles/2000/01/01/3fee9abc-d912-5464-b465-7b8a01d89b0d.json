  "LeadParagraph": "Those who risked their lives for the civil rights movement, like Unita Blackwell, did so to prevent the next generations from having to do the same, a dream largely realized. Ms. Blackwell, 66, the daughter of Mississippi sharecroppers, was regularly attacked and arrested while trying to register black voters, and helped found the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, an alternative to the all-white regular Democrats. She also created several education and housing programs in the state, and in 1976 became mayor of the Delta hamlet of Mayersville (population: 500), which she helped incorporate; it is a position she still holds. Her generation's work seems distant to Marcus Moore, the 20-year-old son of a black Army officer and a white German mother. He grew up in Columbus, Ga., one of many children of interracial marriages at Fort Benning, and is now a senior majoring in African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta. He is editor in chief of ''The Fire This Time,'' Emory's black student magazine, and has been active in campus demonstrations to persuade fraternities to stop displaying the Confederate flag. He helps teach science at a local elementary school and plans to get a Ph.D. in urban anthropology. DAVID FIRESTONE",
