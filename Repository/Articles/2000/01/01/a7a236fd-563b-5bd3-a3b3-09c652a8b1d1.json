  "LeadParagraph": "UNLIKE the sheep named Dolly, the mouse named Lucy has barely made a ripple in the news. Lucy, born on Oct. 26, 1998, is the creation of scientists at Chromos Molecular Systems, a biotechnology company in Vancouver, British Columbia. She has black-brown fur and is not unlike mice bred in laboratories around the world, the company says, with one exception: Lucy has an artificial chromosome that she has passed to her offspring.",
