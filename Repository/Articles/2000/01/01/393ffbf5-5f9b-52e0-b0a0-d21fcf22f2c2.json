  "Abstract": "Hollywood, the semi-real place that helped the 20th century  shape so much of its own image, bid it farewell tonight with a citywide spectacular of song and showmanship, kitsch and multiculturalism grandly intended to herald the emerging Los Angeles of the next millennium.    Perhaps inevitably, the icon of choice was not a microchip, a container ship, a freeway or even a digital video camera, but the hoariest symbol of local self-promotion: the HOLLYWOOD sign.   ",
