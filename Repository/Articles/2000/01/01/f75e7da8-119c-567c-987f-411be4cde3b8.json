  "Abstract": "John Paul II gave his first blessing of the Year 2000 as fireworks exploded and church bells tolled, ushering in the new year across Rome.    ''As we cross the threshold of the new year, I would like to knock at the door of every home, to bring to each of you my cordial good wishes,'' the pope said to about 100,000 people gathered in St. Peter's Square beneath his study window, many holding up torches and candles.
