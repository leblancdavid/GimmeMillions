  "Abstract": "The land that made Carnival and the samba art forms loves nothing more than a party. So the beginning of the 2000's in Rio de Janeiro turned into what authorities proudly called the largest celebration in Brazilian history: an estimated 3.5 million people lining Copacabana, Ipanema and more than 25 miles of other beaches in a tropical spectacle that blended the spiritual and the profane.    For believers of Candomble, Brazil's home-grown mixture of Catholicism and African-derived animist beliefs, New Year's Eve is traditionally the feast day of Iemanja, the fair-skinned goddess of the sea who appears in the guise of the Virgin Mary and is considered the mother of all living things. Beaches are always packed with worshipers who come to seek her blessing on that night, but with the celebration of the millennium, everything that has gone on in the past was multiplied.  ",
