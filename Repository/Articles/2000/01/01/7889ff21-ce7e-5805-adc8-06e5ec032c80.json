  "LeadParagraph": "Schlumberger Ltd., a leading oil services company, said yesterday that the spinoff of its Sedco Forex Offshore unit and its merger with Transocean Offshore Inc. had been completed in a $3.61 billion transaction that creates the world's largest offshore drilling company. Schlumberger investors received one share in Sedco Forex for each share held. The shares were exchanged for 0.1936 share in the new company, Transocean Sedco Forex Inc. Schlumberger shareholders retained a 52 percent stake in the new company. Schlumberger is getting out of offshore rig rentals to concentrate on developing technology that gets more oil out of wells. The merger lets Transocean, the third-largest offshore driller, add to its fleet of deep-water rigs.",
