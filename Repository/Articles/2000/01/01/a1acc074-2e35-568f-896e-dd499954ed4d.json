  "LeadParagraph": "AS commandant of the Army War College, Maj. Gen. Robert H. Scales Jr. regularly leads students, politicians, foreign officers and other visitors on tours through the landmarks of the battlefield here: Devil's Den, Little Round Top, Cemetery Ridge. Though the Battle of Gettysburg was fought 136 years ago, General Scales thinks it still offers lessons on the art of war. At the same time, it is getting harder and harder to see them.",
