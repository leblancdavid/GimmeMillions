  "Abstract": "President Jiang Zemin spoke here of China's glorious future and a few adventurous souls ventured to the Great Wall, but most Beijingers spent the ticking over of the calendar doing what average folks here do when given half a chance: they went shopping.    This week, dozens of shopping centers and department stores across Beijing announced that they would stay open for much of New Year's Eve to honor the event, with a number not closing until 2 a.m. and some not at all.
