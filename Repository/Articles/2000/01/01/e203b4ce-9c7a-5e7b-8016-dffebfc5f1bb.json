  "Abstract": "Earlier in the day, the mayor, who gave himself the job of ubiquitous master of ceremonies of the city's new year celebration, said he began his last morning of the 1900's at 5:30 a.m. having trouble getting his lights on. ''I was convinced that it was Y2K,'' the mayor said, but ''actually I was sleepy.''     Mr. Giuliani spent much of his day in front of cameras. He started at 6:40 a.m. with a news conference at the All-Star Cafe in Times Square, then had interviews from 7 to 8 a.m. with NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox News. He also had two news conferences at the Office of Emergency Management's Command Center at the World Trade Center.   ",
