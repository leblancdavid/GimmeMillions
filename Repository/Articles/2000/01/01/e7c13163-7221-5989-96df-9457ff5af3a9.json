  "Abstract": "The snow everyone had been waiting for all winter finally came. The narrow streets leading down to Red Square, usually clotted with traffic, were empty. For all its imperfections, Moscow on New Year's Eve seemed suddenly, subtly perfect.    Muscovites who would normally elbow each other rushing to work flowed out of the subway station and toward the edges of the Kremlin. All that had changed in Moscow and all that had stayed the same in this decade of unimaginable twists was here.   ",
