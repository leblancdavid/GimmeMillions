  "LeadParagraph": "The centruy's turn has been a time of retrospectives: what was the most important event, who was the most influential thinker? Arts & Ideas decided to take a look ahead at what some of today's researchers are working on. From the most raked-over field, like the history of the ancient world, to the latest medical technology, scholars are coming up with fresh insights. Some ideas may turn into breakthroughs, and others may turn out to be dead-ends, but the journey is rarely boring. Here is a handful of works in progress.",
