  "LeadParagraph": "WHEN Mozart was alive, it took two to three months for a craftsman to make a watch and about 18 minutes for an ensemble to perform ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.'' Today, it takes two minutes for a machine to make a watch. But a performance of Mozart's familiar composition still takes musicians more than a quarter-hour.",
