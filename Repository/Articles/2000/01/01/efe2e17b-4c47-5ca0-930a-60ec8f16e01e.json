  "LeadParagraph": "Its appearance, with 12 months represented in 12 pages, is not so different from that of a calendar you might find hanging on a kitchen wall (except for the words in Latin). But the Julius Work Calendar is nearly 1,000 years old. It was probably created by a cleric working in the manuscript studio at Canterbury Cathedral in England. Down the left side of the page are the days of the month in Roman numerals, and on the right the names of saints and religious festivals. Across the bottom runs a delicate drawing illustrating the task of the month. Over all the calendar offers a window on life in England at the start of the second millennium.",
