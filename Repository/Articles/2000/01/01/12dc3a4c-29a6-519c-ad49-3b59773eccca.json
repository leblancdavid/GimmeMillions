  "LeadParagraph": "The spare farmsteads and bony milk cows of San Jose de Olivares, a desert plateau in central Mexico, are maintained by women and older people. Enriqueta Marquez Martinez, 73, was born there. She has lived much of her life in absolute poverty, never knowing whether there would be food for the next family meal. All of her 10 children went at one time or another to work in the United States, and three settled there permanently. Eventually, when she was in her 60's, Mrs. Marquez also began to travel to the United States.",
