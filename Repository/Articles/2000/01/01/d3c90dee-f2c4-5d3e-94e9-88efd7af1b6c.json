  "Abstract": "Experimental vehicles are being built by General Motors, Ford Motor Co and DaimlerChrysler under umbrella of government-sponsored Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles; they face huge obstacles; Big Three are all focusing on diesel-electric hybrid cars, even though federal and state environmental regulators are adopting new rules for tailpipe emissions that will make it difficult after 2003 to sell cars with diesel engines; Honda Motor and Toyota Motor, operating with much smaller government subsidies, are already mass producing small high-mileage cars that combine gasoline engines and electric motors; manufacturing costs for all hybrid cars, including Japanese models, are steep; selling them at competitive prices remains money-losing proposition; and there is little sign that Americans want high-mileage cars in era of relatively low gasoline prices and rising national prosperity; photos; diagrams (L)",
