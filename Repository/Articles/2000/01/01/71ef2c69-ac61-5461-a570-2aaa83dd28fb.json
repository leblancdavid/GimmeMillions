  "LeadParagraph": "Singapore's economy grew 8.2 percent in the fourth quarter and 5.6 percent for the full year 1999, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said in a New Year message. Mr. Goh noted that the recovery in the economy had been ''much faster than we had expected,'' buttressed by external factors like ''the strong upswing in electronics, the beginnings of a turnaround in Japan and continued robust growth in the United States.'' He said the outlook for 2000 was positive.",
