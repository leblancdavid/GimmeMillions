  "LeadParagraph": "“‘India’ and ‘change’ were once virtual antonyms: old India hands returned again and again in large part because the subcontinent was so dependably different from the West,” Geoffery C. Ward writes in The Sunday Book Review section of The New York Times. “But since 1991, when a financial crisis forced India’s government to devalue the rupee, lower import barriers and relax controls on private investment, things have nearly reversed themselves.” ",
