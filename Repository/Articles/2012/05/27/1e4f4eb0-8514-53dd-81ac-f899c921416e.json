  "LeadParagraph": "Alex Morgan made her debut for the United States women’s national team in 2010 and quickly established herself as a valuable substitute. Last summer, Morgan came off the bench in five of the six games at the World Cup — scoring in both the Americans’ semifinal win over France and their championship game loss to Japan — but this year she has made a case for a regular starting role with a string of stronger performances. Morgan, 22, is the national team’s leading scorer in 2012 with 12 goals, and her 7 assists on second to Lauren Cheney’s 10. Last week, two months before the Olympic soccer tournament kicks off, Morgan spoke with the Goal blog about her preparations for the Games, her goals for this summer and the one opponent she’s keeping an eye on.",
