  "LeadParagraph": "The “mommy wars” have flared up once again, sparked most recently by the publication of the English translation of Elisabeth Badinter’s book, “The Conflict:  How Modern Motherhood Undermines the Status of Women.” In it, Badinter argues that a certain contemporary style of mothering — a style that requires total devotion of mother to child, starting with natural childbirth and extending through exclusive and on-demand breastfeeding, baby-wearing and co-sleeping — undermines women’s equality.  Badinter claims that it does this in several ways:  by squeezing fathers out of any meaningful role in parenting; by placing such high demands on mothers that it becomes nearly impossible to balance paid work with motherhood (especially once fathers have been sidelined); and by sending the message that day care, bottle feeding, sleep training and the other things that allow women to combine motherhood with paid work are harmful to children, and that the women who use them are selfish.",
