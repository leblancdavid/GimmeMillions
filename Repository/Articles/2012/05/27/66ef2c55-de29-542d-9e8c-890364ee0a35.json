  "LeadParagraph": "CANNES, France — On the last day of the Cannes Film Festival, festival attendees swap last-minute guesses about who will win the Palme d’Or and catch up on any of the selections in the main competition during the reprise screenings. By this point, the festival has largely cleared out, save for journalist laggers and, of course, those winners who have stayed in town hoping for a callback to the evening awards ceremony. The market, where thousands of titles are bought and sold by thousands of industry professionals closed Friday, and many journalists are already back home, where doubtless some will decide (as usual!) that this year really wasn’t as bad as it sometimes seemed.",
