  "Snippet": "“Bill W.” traces the history of Bill Wilson, a co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, in the 1930s.",
  "LeadParagraph": "Alcoholics Anonymous has tens of thousands of groups worldwide today, but it had an identifiable beginning with its co-founder Bill Wilson. In their documentary, “Bill W.,” Kevin Hanlon and Dan Carracino recount Wilson’s biography, which is inextricably linked to the developmental history of this lifesaving organization. But this film’s impact is hampered by a slavish adherence to chronology and vintage audio materials.",
