  "LeadParagraph": "CANNES, France — The Canadian director David Cronenberg has a long and eventful history at the Cannes Film Festival: he has competed for the Palme d’Or three times and was awarded a lifetime achievement prize in 2006. He has also stirred controversy both as a filmmaker (presenting the divisive “Crash” in 1996) and as the president of a jury (in 1999) that was both applauded and attacked for its surprising underdog choices.",
